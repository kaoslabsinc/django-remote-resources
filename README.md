# Django remote resources

Sync remote API resources to Django models

## Development and Testing

### IDE Setup

you are using PyCharm, this is already set up.

### Running the Tests

Install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For local environment

```
pytest
```

For all supported environments

```
tox
```
